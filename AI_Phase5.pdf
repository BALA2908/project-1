In the age of digital communication, email and messaging platforms have became essential tools for personal and professional communication. However, the proliferation of spam

Page 2 of 28

messages has became a significant nuisance, causing inconvenience
and potentially leading to security risks. Conventional spam filter’s opten fall short in accurately identifying and filtering out spam, resulting in genuine messages being classified as spam or voice versa.
THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES INCLUDE’S:-
INCREASING ACCURACY
REDUCING FALSE POSTIVIES
HANDLING MULTI MODEL DATA
REAL TIME PROCESSING
SCALABILITY AND GENERALIZATION
USER FRIENDLY INTEGRATION PROBLEM DEFINITION:-
The main thing is to determine the scope of your spam classifier. Are you focusing on email spam, SMS spam, Comment spam, or a combination? Each may have unique characteristics and challenges to identify the scope and
DEFINE OBJECTIVES:-
Clearly state the project’s objectives for example, reducing false positives, achiving a certain accuracy threshold, or handling a specific volume of messsage per day.
USER PERSONA:-

Create a user persona to understand the needs of the end-
user

(example- e-mail user moderaters, administraters) and their pain point’s related to spam

DEVELOPMENT:- PHASE:-1

Building a smarter AI-powered spam classifier involves several steps, starting with loading and preprocessing the dataset. In this, we'll use Python and popular libraries like pandas and scikit-learn to load and preprocess a spam email dataset. It utilizes the NLTK library for text preprocessing and the SCIKIT-learn library for meachine learning.
The script uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to classify messages as spam or non-spam. The accuracy of the model is evaluated.
THE STEPS ARE AS FOLLOW’S:
1: IMPORT LIBRARIES
2: LOAD AND EXPLORE THE DATASET
3: DATA PREPROCESSING

STEP 3:-(DATA PREPROCESSING)
The following data preprocessing steps are performed:


Irrelevant columns are removed: Unnamed: 2, Unnamed: 3, and Unnamed: 4.
Column names are renamed for better understanding: Label, Message.
Labels are converted to binary format (spam: 1, non-spam: 0).


Page 15 of 28

Text data is preprocessed by removing stopwords and applying
TF-IDF vectorization.

# 3. Convert labels to binary (spam: 1, non-spam: 0)
data["Label"] = data["Label"].map({"spam": 1, "ham": 0})# 4. Text preprocessing (removing stopwords and applyingTF-IDF)


stop_words = 'english' # Use the built-in English stop words
tfidf_vectorizer=TfidfVectorizer(stop_words=stop_words,max_feat ures=5000)
x=tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(data["Message"]) #Assuming "v2" contains your text data



STEP 4:-( SPLIT DATA INTO TRAINING AND TESTING SET’S)
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, data["Label"], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)




Page 16 of 28

STEP 5:-( BUILD AND TRAIN THE SPAM CLASSIFIER)
# Build and Train the Spam Classifier

y_pred = classifier.predict(x_test)

STEP 6:-( EVALUATE THE MODEL)
# Evaluate the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
confusion = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:
{:.2f}%".format(accuracy * 100))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion)
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
